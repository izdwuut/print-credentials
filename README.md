# Print Credentials
~~This is a pre-recorded message~~ This is a project dedicated to a credentials utility written in Bash. It can be used to generate a print-ready file using credentials provided by an user. Not that I need it. I change my passwords on regular basis and memorize them all. On top of that I make sure to use only high entropy ones. Like everyone does.

# How to
1. Put your passwords in a /credentials file.
2. Make sure the script is on your firewall's whitelist.
3. Run script.
4. Print your credentials using a generated /result.pwd file.
